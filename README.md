# Working with Camera
Explained how to capture image via Camera in Android.

Integrating camera can be done in two ways. One is to use android inbuilt camera app which is very easy process. This method wonâ€™t give you much control over camera as everything is taken care by inbuilt camera app. This way will be appropriate when your app need just a picture or video from camera.

Second way is to build a custom camera interface and adding the functionality. This needs higher effort as we have to do everything by our own. Building custom camera interface will be useful when you are building an app which mainly deals with images and videos like WhatsApp.
